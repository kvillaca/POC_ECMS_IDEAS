The reasons behind wide use of enums is to avoid those long constant files, that load a lot of static instance variables in memory.
Make the type safe when passing parameters to methods or constructors.
Have a more efficient way to use memory as the enum just load in memory the enum invoked.
Keep the code tide and clean with well defined enums classes.
